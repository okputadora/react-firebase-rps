### Description
*  A multiplayer rock paper scissors game built with React and Firebase
* Allows two people to play and chat
### Remaining Issues/tasks
* Need to track the players scores
* ~~not quite sure how to clear the entire database when the users close their windows~~
* what I probably want to do is allow for multiple games to be played at once
